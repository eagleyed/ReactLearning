# About the Todo App

This is a small todo web application built with `ReactJS`, `Redux (not redux toolkit)` and `TailwindCSS` This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The whole concept is taken from the official react-redux documentation and coded it of my own without any `copy/paste`.

## Installation

Clone or download and then cd to that project folder and run `npm install`. You can do whatever you want with it without my permission :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
